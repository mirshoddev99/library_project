# 📚 Library Project API 📚
Welcome to the Library Project API, developed using Django Rest Framework (DRF). This API allows you to manage a library system with various features and endpoints. Let's dive into the cool features of this project! 🎉

## Features
### 🔒 User Authentication: Secure your API with TokenAuthentication to handle user login, logout, registration, password reset, and password change functionalities. Keep your users' data safe and their access controlled.

✏️ CRUD Operations: 
Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on various resources of the library. 
Manage books, authors, borrowers, and more with ease.

📖 Documentation with Swagger and Redoc: 
We believe in making API documentation as cool as the project itself! Swagger and Redoc have been integrated to provide interactive and user-friendly API documentation. 
You can easily explore and test the API endpoints through these awesome tools.
